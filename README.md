This project is an AI-powered web application that detects over 100 crop pests from images using a lightweight YOLOv11 model. 
It allows users- targeted to  farmers and agricultural expertsâ€” to upload a plant image and get instant predictions on potential pest infestations.

Features:
- Object detection using YOLOv8
- Web interface built with Flask
- Secure file upload
- Uses model with optimized weights
- Deployable on Render or any cloud service
